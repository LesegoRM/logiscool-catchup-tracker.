The Logiscool Catch-up Tracker is a lightweight web application designed to help Logiscool trainers and administrators manage student catch-up lessons efficiently. It allows you to add students, record catch-up sessions, track free vs charged lessons, and generate monthly reports. With built-in CSV export and a modern dashboard styled in Logiscool’s colors, the tool makes catch-up tracking simple, transparent, and professional.

To run the code, you first need to make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your computer. Once that is ready, you can clone this repository from GitHub using the command git clone <repo-url> and then navigate into the project folder. It’s also recommended to create a virtual environment so that all dependencies for this project remain isolated from your global Python installation.

After setting up your environment, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. This can be done by running pip install -r requirements.txt inside your virtual environment. These dependencies include FastAPI, Uvicorn, and SQLite support, which are necessary to run the backend server and manage the database for storing student and catch-up information.

Once everything is installed, you can start the application by running the command uvicorn app:app --reload. This will launch a local development server on your machine. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the dashboard, add students, record catch-ups, and generate reports. If you want to reset the database for testing, simply delete the logiscool.db file and the app will recreate a fresh one automatically the next time it runs.
